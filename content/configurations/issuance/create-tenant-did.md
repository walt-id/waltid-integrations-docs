# Creating a DID for a tenant

A DID for a tenant can be either:

- [created](tenant-did/create-did.md) - will create the key pair and the DID having the specified DID method
- [imported](tenant-did/import-did.md) - will import the specified DID document into _WalletKit_ (might require importing the key as well)
