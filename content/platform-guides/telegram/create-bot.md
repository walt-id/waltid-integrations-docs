# Create Telegram bot

## Using the official creator bot

Telegram provides an easy way for you to create a bot.

In this case, you will use a bot to create your bot.

Open up Telegram and simply message `@BotFather` (https://t.me/BotFather).

Make sure that the bot you are messaging has the verified blue tick after its name.

This is how the conversation goes:

```
[You]:
/newbot

[BotFather]:
Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.

[You]:
walt.id

[BotFather]:
Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.

[You]:
waltid_bot

[BotFather]:
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/waltid_bot. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.

Use this token to access the HTTP API:
123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.

For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
