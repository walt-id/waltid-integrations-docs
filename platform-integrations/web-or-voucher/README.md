# Web | Voucher

## Intro

Walt.id integrations offers SSI in many forms and with this integration it enables the issuance of credentials via voucher codes. It allows you to create and distribute voucher codes to users, who can then redeem these codes in a web portal to claim a specified credential.&#x20;
