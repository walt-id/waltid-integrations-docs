## Voucher functionality

In addition to the Voucher REST interface, a CSV file can also be imported
using the Discord bot. To do so, type the command `/importcsv` and click the
option "file". You will see the following screen:

You can either press the big file icon to open a file chooser (choose your .csv file from there),
or you can drag & drop your .csv file onto the file icon.

By pressing enter the file will be imported into the Voucher example.
By default, this is restricted to users with `Permission.ADMINISTRATOR`.
