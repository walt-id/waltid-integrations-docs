# Wallet-Kit

The wallet-kit gives us the functionality, waltid-integrations need in order to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials on different platforms. Learn more about wallet-kit here.

To make the wallet-kit work with waltid-integrations, we need the following in place:

1. [The Wallet-Kit](local-setup.md) - up and running on our machine
2. [A DID (Decentralised Identifier)](create-a-did/) - used by the issuer
3. [A configured issuer](configure-issuer.md) - referencing the DID created previously
4. [Credential Templates](credential-templates/) - used to issue Credentials to the end user

We can configure the wallet-kit using the command line tool or the REST API. First, let's run the project.
